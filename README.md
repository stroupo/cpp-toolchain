# C++ Toolchain

C++ is a complicated and big language.
Its backwards compatibility on the one hand and modern features on the other hand make it difficult to find a good starting point for writing your own code.
This becomes even worse if we think about additional tools like `CMake` or `git` which clearly optimize the complete process of developing but introduce a tremendous penalty in the learning process because most of these tools cannot be not be added in an intuitive way to the development workflow if one has never used them.
Even for writing simple C++ programs one has to think about a lots of other tools.
We cannot really do something about this.
But we can provide some sort of documentation which outlines the most important tools and how to use them efficiently in your own project without thinking too much about them.
